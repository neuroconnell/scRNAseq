# R code for analysis of scRNA-sequencing and ATAC data.
A library of R and Python code, leveraging modern single-cell analyses methods to predict gene expression of sorted serotonergic neurons. Repositories include example applications of native Seurat, alternative and advanced analysis pipelines for modeling and predicting differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility. 

R Repositories:
  1. General Seurat analysis pipeline
  2. NEBULA (Negative binomial modeling) for DEG prediction (frequentist)
  3. ParetoTI (Task inference for identifying archetypal gene expression programs)
  4. Signac (Analysis of chromatin accessibility, ATAC)
